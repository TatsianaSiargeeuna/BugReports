**1. Recommendations for usability**

**All these recommendations apply to mobile devices**

**1.1. General:**

**General recommendations: **

-   Improve translation of the site (there is a need in translating the
    whole page when changing the language)
    *https://i.imgur.com/PwCS009.png* *https://i.imgur.com/4C4T8LG.png* 

-   Add “Go up” button on all pages 

-   Console: Fix errors in scripts through the whole site
    *https://i.imgur.com/m6kc6sU.jpg* 

-   It’s a good practice to show the customer "recent purchases" /
    “similar products” / “previously viewed items”

-   Add simple design and short clear message about what happened and
    what user can do for lost pages with 404 error to make it more
    friendly for customers

    the list.

**Search page/Search-bar:** 

-   Set up a more user-friendly page (add a simple design and message
    what to do or where to find the required item) for the empty search
    result page “no results found”

**Catalog page:**

-   Make visible to the customer the most popular categories and
    bestseller products right after the launch

    product should be visible in the catalog and on the product page,
    add the “last pair” / “last item” badge if there is only one product
    left

**3. Recommendations for speed optimization**

During the checks, slow performance on the pages of the main website was
revealed:

1\) Home page loading speed: 3,13 sec:
[*https://i.imgur.com/qXxgJeS.jpg*](https://i.imgur.com/qXxgJeS.jpg)   

2\) Catalog page loading speed: 3,92 sec:
[*https://i.imgur.com/tB7F7am.png*](https://i.imgur.com/tB7F7am.png) 

3\) Product page loading speed: 3,45 sec:
[*https://i.imgur.com/QI2szIo.png*](https://i.imgur.com/QI2szIo.png) 

Google page speed recommendations: Ideal website load time for mobile
sites is 1-2 seconds. 53% of mobile site visits are abandoned if pages
take longer than 3 seconds to load. A 2-second delay in load time
resulted in abandonment rates of up to 87%.

Therefore, please pay attention to the product page loading speed on
your site: It takes about **3-4** sec to load any page, which may affect
visitors' decision to continue purchase flow.

You can see the performance grades and ways to improve them.
